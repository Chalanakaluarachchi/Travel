                    <h1>Beaches</h1>
                    <p>Sri Lanka's tropical beaches are unanimously adored. 
                        Crafted from a 1340km (833-mile) coastline, its countless topographically varied beaches, 
                        coves and bays attract sun-seekers, fun lovers and surfers throughout the year.</p>

                    <h5>Unawatuna</h5>
                    <p>Unawatuna, 6km (3.7 miles) from history-laden Galle Fort,
                         is still one of the most sought-after swimming beaches in Sri Lanka, <br>
                        despite encroaching development. Sun beds line the beach, 
                        Jet Skis buzz around the bay and although it gets busy during peak season. 
                        Unawatuna’s dining scene is sophisticated, and there are regular weekend beach parties.</p>

                <div class="card card2">
                    <h5>Mirissa</h5>
                    <p>Many of those descending upon Mirissa’s gentle moon-shaped bay are here for the blue whales; boats depart daily during the season for half-day cruises,
                         and sightings are good. Yet its appeal runs much deeper – you can snorkel in the bay east of Parrot Rock or surf its western reef break, 
                         take a yoga class or enjoy a scenic ramble, such as to Mirissa’s (not so) Secret Beach. Restaurants are plentiful, and evenings can be lively.</p>

                    <h5>Benthota</h5>
                    <p>Sri Lanka’s west coast is dominated by large package-holiday hotels basking over fine stretches of sand.
                         The best is Bentota,<br>
                        where the long honey-hued beach ends in a spit of sand separating the Indian Ocean from a big lagoon. 
                        A combination of water sports,<br>
                        decent swimming and lifeguards<br> attract families, <br>
                        though there are no independent restaurants on the beach itself.

                    <h5>Arugam Bay Beach</h5>
                    <p>East coast A-Bay is Sri Lanka’s surfing trump. Best between May and September, 
                        it has a variety of evocatively named breaks – Whiskey Point,
                         Peanut Farm, Crocodile Rock – in wild, unspoiled and sometimes hard-to-reach locations. 
                         Once the preserve of die-hard surfers and fishermen, <br>
                         Arugam Bay attracts budget-conscious sun-seekers looking to combine surfing with visits to deserted beaches, historic temples and remote national parks (Kumana and Lahugala Kitulana).</p>
